# React-Router-Online-Store

- Lets build out an Online store, using Router, Route and link.
- You'll need to build out a few components here.
- Use create-react-app to make an application, name it Online store.

- Make it so When a user clicks on an item card they should be taken to /item/{id of item here} to see the details for the selected item.
- You should now be able to navigate back and forth between the individual item and the home page.
